# Gabrielly Holanda - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Gabrielly! 
I have an analytical background in civil engineering and I'm passionate about data analysis and technology, with a multifaceted professional journey spanning from the field to the corporate environment. I began my career working on construction sites, where I developed a deep understanding of the challenges and complexities of the construction industry.

Over time, I transitioned to the construction company's office, where I discovered my passion for data analysis. Immersing myself in this fascinating world, I realized the transformative power that analytical insights can have on companies' strategic decision-making.

I have hands-on experience in Power BI, SQL, Python, and data modeling, creating interactive dashboards that reveal key trends and support informed decisions.
My goal is to continue making significant contributions to the company's success by applying my technical knowledge and passion for data analysis to drive innovation and promote operational excellence.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Business Analyst.
